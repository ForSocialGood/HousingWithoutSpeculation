# HousingWithoutSpeculation

We believe that Housing is a Social Good [1]

Counties and Cities need good housing in order to thrive. So how do you balance good investment with affordability.

## Hypotheses:

* Speculation raises prices artificially
* Commissions are sales raise prices artificially
* Speculation discourages reinvestment and reduces Housing stock quality
* Artificially high prices make rentals non-profitable
* Realistically priced properties will promote high quality 
* Lack of continuity of Trade businesses reduces Housing stock quality
* There are no valuations only sales history

## Goals

* Raise the quality of Housing stock i.e. well maintained
* Rationalise House prices
* Encourage profitable rental investment
* Encourage investment in building Houses suited for living not filling up space
* Create a housing price index, which is a rate to signify the change in maintenance and building costs.

## Process

### Housing Captital Gains Tax

* Applied on realisation i.e. settlement of a sale
* Applied to difference between last sale price and current sale price adjusted by housing price index
* Calculated at 100% for the first year then reducing by 1% per month until it reaches 20%
